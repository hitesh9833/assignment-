## Project Overview

This project implements a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API for managing users and files in the file system. It provides endpoints to create, retrieve, update, and delete user information and files stored on the server.

## Features

- **User Management**: Users can be created, retrieved, updated, and deleted through API endpoints. User information such as name, email, and profile picture can be stored and managed.
- **File System Integration**: Files can be uploaded, retrieved, updated, and deleted through API endpoints. The file system is used to store and manage uploaded files.
- **Error Handling**: The API includes robust error handling mechanisms using an error wrapper to ensure reliability and graceful error recovery. Errors are appropriately logged and formatted for easy debugging.
- **Security**: Authentication and authorization mechanisms can be implemented to secure the API endpoints and control access to user and file resources.
- **Scalability**: The project architecture is designed to be scalable, allowing for easy expansion and addition of new features as requirements evolve.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation is provided to guide developers on how to use the API endpoints and integrate them into their applications.

## Usage

To use the API, follow the instructions provided in the documentation. You'll need to set up the project environment, configure the database connection, and start the server. Once the server is running, you can make HTTP requests to the API endpoints to perform CRUD operations on users and files.
